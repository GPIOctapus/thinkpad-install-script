# thinkpad-install-script
a script to install all bare-bones software on my thinkpad t410

This script is meant to be run on an artix/arch operating system, this WILL NOT work for any other linux distrobution.

# software

all software that is installed is personalized to me, the list of all installed software is as follows

 - i3 (DE)
 - st (CLI)
 - lynx (browser)
 - transmission (torrenting)
 - penetration testing tools
 - vim
 - doom emacs
 - tor browser
 - profanity (XMPP client)

It will be assumed that this script is ran in the home folder of the user of this script,

various configurations, such as the desktop environment, will not be configured heavily. I believe that this should be done by the user instead of the script.
